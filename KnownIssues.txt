Release notes
Project in its current state contains naive parser with some basic validations and solver for puzzles with small amount of pieces (up to 45).

Known issues
Missing features
1.	Parser functional is under construction - missing error aggregation

2.	Several input file validations aren't supported. 
3.	Possible validations for number of strait sides isnâ€™t supported (program tries to solve puzzle in case of number of lines that can be eliminated before).
4.	Algorithm doesn't support big (>45) amount of pieces.

Known issues in design
1.	There is a lack in generic algorithm logic: puzzles of 1 line and 1 column are treated separately.
2.	Missing unit tests.
