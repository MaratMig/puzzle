Release notes
Project in its current state contains naive parser with some basic validations and solver for puzzles with small amount of pieces (up to 45).
Pre-defined file is used as an input and console is used for the output.

Known issues
Missing features
1.	Parser functional is under construction - missing error aggregation
2.	There is no ability to summarize errors during validation/solving process.
3.	Several input file validations aren't supported. 
4.	Possible validations for number of strait sides isnâ€™t supported (program tries to solve puzzle in case of number of lines that can be eliminated before).
5.	Algorithm doesn't support big (>45) amount of pieces.

Known issues in design
1.	There is a lack in generic algorithm logic: puzzles of 1 line and 1 column are treated separately.
2.	Missing unit tests.
